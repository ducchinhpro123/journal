# It is as it is

Beauty is subjective, so i stop telling people about beauty. I used to tell people a lot about beauty: about the beauty of a program, about beauty of an algorithm that is used to solve a problem. But then, each person has their own definition of beauty. The beauty of something is not defined by what
we see, but by what we feel. Well, of course what we see is important, but there must be a connection between what we see and what we feel.

When you tell people about something you love, some will like, while some won't, so beauty is subjective.


# Socket in C

What is the socket in context of programming, C language?

```c
sockfd = socket(p->ai_family, p->ai_socktype, p->ai_protocol);
```

I'm asking my OS: "*hey, create that doorway for my program*"

So, if the OS created successfully that *doorway*, it will give me a *file descriptor*, think of it as a ticket which we can use to handle our program.
To tell the OS which doorway it's referring to.

Think of it in this way: "It's like a doorway for a building (your program)". Other computers can send data towards this doorway.


## send and receive

from [beej guide](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#sendrecv):

> `send` and `receiv`, these two functions are for communicating over stream sockets or connected datagram sockets.

which is pretty cool

in `client.c`, i can just send a message like this:

```c
char *s = "Hello from client";
int num_bytes_sent;

if ((num_bytes_sent = send(sockfd, s, strlen(s), 0)) == -1) {
    perror("client: send");
    close(sockfd);
    exit(1);
}
printf("bytes sent: %d\n", num_bytes_sent);
```

from `server.c`:


```c
char buf[100];
ssize_t t = recv(new_fd, buf, sizeof buf, 0);
```

Boomb! send data back and forth, amazing.


## Get the address info

Well, just ask Gemini on how to get the address of the server we are connecting to. Although reading Beej, he talks about `inet_ntop` function
that do this purpose but i too dump to understand :(

```c
inet_ntop(p->ai_family,
        p->ai_family == AF_INET ?
        (void *) &(((struct sockaddr_in *)p->ai_addr)->sin_addr) :
        (void *) &(((struct sockaddr_in6 *)p->ai_addr)->sin6_addr)
        , s, sizeof s);
printf("Connecting to %s\n...", s);
freeaddrinfo(servinfo);
```

and server can also get the client address:

```c
inet_ntop(clients.ss_family, // address family
          clients.ss_family == AF_INET
              ? (void *)&(((struct sockaddr_in *)(&clients))->sin_addr)
              : (void *)&(((struct sockaddr_in6 *)(&clients))->sin6_addr),
          ipstr, sizeof ipstr);
```

## Client send - Server listen

How about client just keep sending messages, server just print that message to the console?

*server.c* keep listening incomming messages

```c
while ((num_bytes = recv(new_fd, buf, 99, 0)) > 0) {
    buf[num_bytes] = '\0';
    printf("msg reic: %s\n", buf);
    printf("num bytes: %d\n", num_bytes);
}
```

*client.c* keep taking messages from user

```c
while (1) {
    printf("> ");
    fflush(stdout);

    // num_bytes = recv(sockfd, buf, MAXDATASIZE - 1, 0);
    if (fgets(buf, MAXDATASIZE - 1, stdin) == NULL) {
        printf("existing...");
        break;
    }

    buf[strcspn(buf, "\n")] = 0;
    if (strlen(buf) == 1 && strcmp(&buf[0], "q") == 0) {
        break;
    }

    if (send(sockfd, buf, strlen(buf), 0) == -1) {
        perror("send");
        return 1;
    }
}
```
